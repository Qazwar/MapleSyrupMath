# MapleSyrupMath
As much as I usually toot my own horn for the jokes, I must clarify, this library sucks, intentionally or not is a question to be asked by me.

Poor formatting for now, no headers, all functions are implemented in main.c,
I plan on changing that sooner or later.

However, 100% of this code was written by me, at most I'd look at a mathematic model and make something out of it, or just have offsets.
None of this is C&P, and I sincerely hope nobody does so to me without credits.
As many math libraries as there are, I'm doing this for the understanding of the implementation whenever I write fsin(x).
